      <p>Hello!<br>We are a family-operated business, established in the Grand Lake area of Oakland since 2005.<br>
        We offer both water canal style sushi in custom-made boats, and table service for larger groups. Feel free 
        to drop by for any occasion, whether it's a quick bite to eat during the workday, a birthday celebration, 
        watching the big game, or relaxing and having a delicious meal.<br>
        Love, Mama-San and Papa-San</p>
